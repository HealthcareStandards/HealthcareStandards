# Transition of Care Count Tool

This tool is used to get different counts based off of ToC transmission files sitting in a folder. In order to run the script download the [Transition_Of_Care_File_Counts.ps1](https://github.com/HealthcareStandards/HealthcareStandards/blob/master/TransitionOfCare/CCDAHybrid/Scripts/ToC%20Counts%20Tool/Transition_Of_Care_File_Counts.ps1) powershell script and run the below command. This will create a log file in the same folder as the script and also log message to the console.
